# Thread Coordination and Resource Management with Singletons
This code is a multi-threaded C++ program that uses the Singleton design pattern, the std::promise and std::future constructs, 
and various synchronization mechanisms. The main purpose of the code is to create and run four different threads named A, B, C, and D, 
along with a Controller thread that manages the others. The program demonstrates the use of thread-safe Singleton classes and synchronization techniques.

# Important parts of the code:

CtrlSingleton and ThrdCounter classes: These are Singleton classes that manage the resources needed for synchronization. 

Singleton design pattern ensures that there's only one instance of each class throughout the lifetime of the program.

A, B, C, and D classes: These classes inherit from BannerBase and define the behavior of each of the four threads. Each class has a constructor 
and an overloaded operator() function that takes a reference to a std::future<void> object. Inside the operator() function, 
a while loop is run until the future object is ready, and the thread performs its specific task in each iteration.

Controller class: This class also inherits from BannerBase and has an overloaded operator() function that takes a std::promise<void> object. 
This thread waits for a keypress, then sets the value for the promise object, which will signal the A, B, C, and D threads to exit their loops.

main() function: This is the entry point of the program. It creates instances of the A, B, C, D, and Controller classes, spawns the threads, and starts them. 
It also creates a std::promise and std::future pair for synchronization, and calls the _getch() function to wait for a keypress before notifying the Controller thread.

# Key points to note:
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. 
It is particularly useful when you need to coordinate actions across multiple threads or objects.

In this code, the CtrlSingleton and ThrdCounter classes are implemented as Singletons, ensuring that only one instance of each class is created throughout the program. The methods GetInstance() in both classes are responsible for creating and returning the unique instances.

The Singleton pattern is used here to manage shared resources (mutex and condition variables) and to coordinate the execution of threads in a synchronized manner. By using the Singleton pattern, the code ensures that all threads interact with the same instance of the ControllerSingleton and TCSingleton classes, providing a consistent and controlled way of managing synchronization and thread coordination.

However, it is worth noting that the Singleton pattern can sometimes be considered an anti-pattern due to its global state and potential issues with testing and maintainability. As such, it's important to carefully consider when and how to use it in your projects. In this particular case, the Singleton pattern seems to be a suitable choice for managing shared resources and coordinating threads.
